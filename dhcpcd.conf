#Speed up DHCP by disabling ARP probing
#dhcpcd contains an implementation of a recommendation of 
#the DHCP standard (RFC2131 section 2.2) to check via ARP 
#if the assigned IP address is really not taken. 
#This seems mostly useless in home networks, 
#so you can save about 5 seconds on every connect if ARP is disabled.
